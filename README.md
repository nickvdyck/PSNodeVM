#To-Do
1. Extract constant value from module into config file
2. Create function to read config file and generate config file (add both of them ot module) -all private functions
3. Create Setup-PSNodeJSManager -> To setup environment based on config file
	- Default config file
	- User config file (other locatioion -> to prevent updates from overriding file): user file should be used before default file
